# FairBNB

FairBNB is a new kind of rental platform designed to make renting homes safer, fairer, and simpler for everyone. It takes away confusing middlemen like brokers and agents who often charge huge fees and removes the risks tenants and landlords face with deposits and disputes. Using modern technology, FairBNB helps both landlords and tenants trust each other and complete rental transactions smoothly.

## What We Are  

We are a rental marketplace and dispute resolution platform that uses innovative technology to replace the need for brokers and middlemen. Our system puts control back into the hands of landlords and tenants, making renting transparent, trustworthy, and less expensive.  

**Fun Fact:** The name *FairBNB* is a triple entendre - a clever play on *fairness*, the popular rental platform *Airbnb*, and the blockchain network *BNB Chain* powering us. Feeling a bit like Kendrick Lamar with this level of wordplay!

## The Real-World Problem  

Renting a house or apartment today can be costly and complicated. Brokers charge high fees—often equal to a whole month’s rent—and tenants usually have to block even more money as a security deposit. Issues with scams, unclear agreements, and disputes over damage or payments leave both landlords and tenants stressed and vulnerable.  

Resolving problems is slow and expensive, often requiring legal help. This especially affects busy cities like Mumbai, where rental turnover is high and trust can be scarce. Many tenants lose money or get unfairly treated, and landlords face rental defaults and property misuse.

## What We Do  

FairBNB changes the rental experience with a simple idea: trust and payments should be automatic, transparent, and fair—without relying on any intermediaries.  

- Landlords list their properties as unique digital records that can’t be altered or faked.  
- Tenants book these rentals by locking their money in a secure, automatic payment system.  
- If there are no issues, payments are released fairly after the rental ends and deposits returned.  
- If there is a dispute, a community jury made up of real people fairly reviews evidence and decides, with incentives that encourage honesty and unbiased judgment.  

This creates a fair rental market with less hassle, lower costs, and real security for both sides.

## Project Overview  

FairBNB is built on blockchain technology—a way to keep records that are unchangeable and transparent. This technology powers our platform’s key features like digital property listings as NFTs, secure payment escrows, and decentralized dispute resolution.  

Our goal is to make renting easier and safer, helping landlords rent out properties faster and tenants find trustworthy homes without overpaying or worrying about scams.

## How the Platform Works  

### Listing Properties as NFTs  

Landlords create unique digital tokens (NFTs) representing their rental properties. These tokens store all important details like the monthly rent, required deposit, and a small dispute fee that both tenant and landlord pay monthly. Pictures and documents related to the property are stored securely and cannot be altered or deleted.

### Booking and Escrow  

When a tenant books a property, their rent, security deposit, and dispute fee are safely locked in a smart contract — a computer program that holds payments securely on the blockchain. The landlord only gets paid once the rental period ends and both parties confirm satisfaction.

### Fair and Transparent Disputes with Community Jury  

Disputes can happen, and when they do, FairBNB ensures a transparent, unbiased, and fair resolution through a decentralized jury system:

- Any dispute raised requires the landlord and tenant to upload evidence such as photos and documents.
- These cases are reviewed by a randomly selected group of community members known as jurors.
- To ensure commitment and seriousness, jurors must stake tokens before they can participate in ruling cases.
- The jury members’ identities are fully hidden and anonymous, preventing bribery or external influence.
- Jurors are assigned cases randomly and have a fixed timeframe to review and vote.
- An odd number of jurors ensures decisions cannot be split evenly; majority rules.
- If the tenant wins the dispute, the landlord’s dispute fee is distributed as a reward among jurors to encourage honest and diligent decision-making.
- This system incentivizes jurors to act fairly and protects the community’s trust in the platform.

This decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanism empowers the community to govern disputes effectively while rewarding their participation and integrity.

### Typical Scenarios  
- If both parties agree that everything went well, the landlord receives the rental payments and dispute fees are returned.  
- If a dispute is raised, it is examined by the community jury who fairly decide the outcome.  
- If the tenant wins, the landlord’s dispute fee is shared among the jurors as a reward.

## Technology Stack  

- Frontend built with **Vite and React.js**, styled using **TailwindCSS** and **ShadCN**, featuring a modern neo-brutalism design  
- Backend powered by **Node.js and Express.js**  
- Smart contracts developed in **Solidity** with **Hardhat** and **Ethers.js** for NFT minting, escrow, and DAO logic  
- Rental listings, metadata, and dispute evidence stored on **BNB Greenfield** decentralized storage, with **Pinata IPFS** as a reliable fallback  
- Runs on **BNB Chain testnet**, enabling fast and affordable transactions  

---

## Additional Ideas We Are Planning  

- Image authenticity checks using **EXIF metadata** to detect photo tampering and ensure fair evidence presentation in disputes  
- Machine learning models to analyze image authenticity and assign trust scores  
- Potentially restricting photo uploads to live camera captures for even higher trust (still under evaluation)  
- Backup data storage on IPFS to ensure no loss even if we face blockchain resets or upgrades

## Economics and Market Impact  

Renting via traditional means in cities like Mumbai involves upfront costs that are hard to afford: brokers take about one month’s rent as commission, and tenants deposit two months’ rent. These deposits tie up large sums that could otherwise be used productively.  

FairBNB slashes these costs by charging just a 2% platform fee and requiring only one month’s rent as deposit in escrow. Our system also creates income opportunities for the community members who participate as jurors in dispute resolution. This model benefits landlords, tenants, and the community alike by making rentals more affordable and disputes fairer.

## Financial Model  

- We charge a **2% fee on escrow transactions** to cover platform costs.  
- Community jurors **stake tokens to join dispute resolution** and earn rewards from dispute fees. A portion of the dispute fees are shared with jurors, motivating fair decisions.  
- The platform grows sustainably as more rentals happen, increasing transaction volumes and DAO participation.

## Why We Use BNB Chain  

BNB Chain provides the ideal infrastructure for FairBNB: a blockchain with **very low fees** per transaction, making monthly rent payments practical. It offers **high transaction speeds** to scale with growing users. Its decentralized storage system, **BNB Greenfield**, allows permanent, tamper-proof rental agreements and evidence storage at a low cost. The large BNB ecosystem offers ready wallets and tools to onboard users smoothly.

## Future Directions  

- Implement live video and timestamped evidence submission  
- Build a reputation system scoring landlords, tenants, and jurors  
- Expand from Mumbai to other Indian cities and eventually global rental markets  
- Integrate with official property registries and local laws  
- Enhance AI-powered tools for fraud detection and evidence verification
